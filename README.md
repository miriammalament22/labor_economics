## Description

This repository contains the teaching materials and resources for the **Labor Economics** course taught by Professor Julio Elías, for which I served as a Teaching Assistant in 2022. The materials are designed to introduce students to R programming, provide an understanding of household surveys in Argentina, and offer a straightforward approach to analyzing data from the Encuesta Permanente de Hogares (EPH). Additionally, the repository includes solutions to problem sets to reinforce learning.
